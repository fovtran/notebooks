en = sq.rt.[ ei^2 + (R*in)^2 + 2RkT ]

where:
en = output noise voltage
ei = input voltage noise of opamp
in = input current noise of opamp
R = source impedance seen by input (should be matched at each input for best performance)
k = Boltzmann's constant
T = temperature in degrees Kelvin (approx. Celcius + 300)
